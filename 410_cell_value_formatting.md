# 4.2.0 Cell Value Formatting

Cell Value Formatting allows you to set up a formatting condition that relies on a value that is contained within each cell that formatting is applied to. This basically allows you to compare each cell to some value and based on some simple comparison operators like "equals" or "less than" you can apply certain style to cell based on that comparison result. 

### 4.2.1 Choose Operator Type and Values

Based on what Operator Type you chose, you will either have to supply one or more values that each cell will be evaluated against. Operator Types available are pretty straight forward and are mostly similar to some of the logical operators that you have already seen in Excel:

<blockquote>

<p> 1. Equal - requires (1) value for comparison. </p>
<p> 2. NotEqual - requires (1) value for comparison. </p>
<p> 3. Greater - requires (1) value for comparison. </p>
<p> 4. GreaterEqual - requires (1) value for comparison. </p>
<p> 5. Less - requires (1) value for comparison. </p>
<p> 6. LessEqual - requires (1) value for comparison. </p>
<p> 7. Between - requires (2) values for comparison. </p>
<p> 8. NotBetween - requires (2) values for comparison. </p>
