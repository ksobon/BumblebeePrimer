# 4.2.0 Cell Value Formatting

Cell Value Formatting allows you to set up a formatting condition that relies on a value that is contained within each cell that formatting is applied to. This basically allows you to compare each cell to some value and based on some simple comparison operators like "equals" or "less than" you can apply certain style to cell based on that comparison result.
