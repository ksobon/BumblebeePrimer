##Acknowledgements

A special thanks to David Mans for making such an awesome Excel Interop plug-in for Grasshopper that was not only an inspiration for this project but also a great resource and a learning tool. You can access David's website here: http://www.neoarchaic.net/

Also, special thanks to my crew at BadMonkey for doing some early Bumblebee implementation tests and being a great resource when developing better functionality. Yes, Adam, I am looking at you and your UI++ tool that is probably the best thing that happened to Dynamo in a while.
