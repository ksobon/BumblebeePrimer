### 4.4.1 Define Min and Max Value Types

You can define rules of how this color gradient will be applied to range of numbers by specifying Min and Max value types. This can either be as simple as "automatic" or as custom as inputting an actual number for a min/max value. 

Let's have a quick look at available options and their meaning.

<blockquote>
<p><b> LowestValue:</b> If you chose this option, Excel will automatically chose the lowest value in the specified range and use that as a Minimum. Chosing this option means that you DO NOT have to supply MinValue. </p>
<p><b> Number: </b> If you chose this option, you will have to also supply MinValue input that will determine the minimum number. 
<p><b>Percent:</b> If you chose this option you will have to supply MinValue and it will have to be between 0-100. </p>
<p><b> Formula: </b> You can use a Formula to determine a MinValue. If you chose to use the formula then, you have to supply it to MinValue input. </p>
<p><b> Percentile:</b> 
<p><b> HighestValue:</b>
<p><b> AutomaticMax:</b>
<p><b> AutomaticMin:</b>
<p><b> None:</b>
